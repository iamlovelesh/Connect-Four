# Pull Requests
I welcome and encourage all pull requests. It usually will take me within 10-21 hours to respond to any issue or request. Here are some basic rules to follow to ensure timely addition of your request:
1. Match coding style (braces, spacing, etc.) This is best achieved using Reformat Code feature of VS Code SHIFT+Option+F on Mac and SHIFT + ALT + F on Linux + Windows .
2. If its a feature, bugfix, or anything please only change code to what you specify.
3. Please keep PR titles easy to read and descriptive of changes, this will make them easier to merge :)
4. Pull requests must be made against develop branch. Any other branch (unless specified by the maintainers) will get rejected.
5. Check for existing issues first, before filing an issue.
6. Make sure you follow the set standard as all other projects in this repo do
7. Have fun!
